    <pre style="background-color: aqua;">
        Deep into that darkness peering,

        Long I stood there, wondering, fearing,
        
        Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals
        
        Ever dared to dream before;
        
        But the silence was unbroken,
        
        And the stillness gave no token,
        
        And the only word there spoken
        
        Was the whispered word, "Lenore!"
        
        This I whispered, and an echo
        
        Murmured back the word, "Lenore!"
        
        Merely this, and nothing more.
